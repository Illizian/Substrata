# Substrata
=========

A lightweight, minimalist, responsive, semantic grid powered, unstyled, front-end boilerplate.

## What is it?

An attempt to create a bare-bones frontend foundation upon which new projects can quickly and easily be built.

I want to:

	$ git clone https://github.com/shaunch/Substrata.git my-new-project
	$ cd my-new-project
	$ npm install
	$ bower install
	$ subl .

... and begin what's unique to this project.


## What's included?

It's inspired heavily by and borrows code from Twitter Bootstrap, HTML5 Boilerplate and Semantic Grid System amongst others. Also includes jQuery.


## What's not?
Pre-defined styles, beyond very basic defaults.


## What's next?
- gruntfile for watch / server / build (less compile, minification, livereload)
- bower.json instead of including vendor files
- package.json to install grunt requirements
- basic transition mixins
