# Substrata

A lightweight, minimalist, responsive, semantic grid powered, unstyled, front-end boilerplate with skeleton build and deployment tools. 

## What is it?

An attempt to create a bare-bones frontend foundation upon which new projects can quickly and easily be built, to remove the barrier of setup from building quick simple websites.

I want to:

	$ git clone https://github.com/shaunchurch/Substrata.git my-new-project
	$ cd my-new-project
	$ npm install
	$ bower install
	$ subl .	
	$ grunt server

... and begin what's unique to this project.


## What's included?

It's inspired heavily by and borrows code from Twitter Bootstrap, HTML5 Boilerplate and Semantic Grid System amongst others. It then bundles a Gruntfile with some useful tasks to handle livereload, compilation of Jade (layouts and partials), Less, CoffeeScript and Markdown, and supports quick static site generation.

It's everything I need to make a quick new site with a ready made workflow.

## What's not?
Pre-defined styles, beyond very basic defaults.


## What's next?
- Deployment setup
- Fix copy task
- RSS /feed.xml
- Add carefully selected base styles?
- Parsley for in built form validation?
- Maybe switch to .sass because I'm getting sick of curly brackets?
