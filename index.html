                    <h3>What is it?</h3>
                    <p>An attempt to create a bare-bones frontend foundation upon which new projects can quickly and easily be built.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature">
                    <h3>What's included?</h3>
                    <p>It's inspired heavily by and borrows code from Twitter Bootstrap, HTML5 Boilerplate and Semantic Grid System amongst others. Also includes jQuery.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="feature">
                    <h3>What's not?</h3>
                    <p>Any pre-defined UI or designed components, beyond very basic default typography, spacing and action buttons.</p>
                </div>

            <article>
                <h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>
                <p>There are some superb bits of code lying around out there that help us get to work faster and smarter. So far I haven't seen a boilerplate that seems to be the ideal starting point for a developer looking to jump straight into building a new project with as few restrictions as possible.</p>
                <p>Bootstrap is heavy, and contains lots of recognisable components that have to be redesigned. It's often overkill; too much. HTML5 Boilerplate comes with some great defaults but isn't quite enough to get me working on what makes this project unique right away. I have to create directories, copy standard files, set up fonts, grab common code snippets, etc.</p>
                <p>I want something that's very lightweight but powerful: a grid system that leaves my markup alone, modernisation and HTML5/CSS3 support for older browsers, a useful set of ready-to-go mixins, and a stark template that serves as a blank canvas to begin working on.</p>
                <p><strong>This is Substrata.</strong> A set of CSS, JS and HTML starting files that aims to find that sweet spot between too much and too little. Enough to get you going, but not so much it gets in your way.</p> 
                <p>At the time of writing, the minified CSS file weighs just 8Kb! For comparison, Bootstrap's minified CSS file weighs in at 103Kb plus an additional 17kb for the responsive styles. </p>
                <p>Clearly, Substrata doesn't have anything close to the features of Bootstrap, but that's because we often don't need or want all that. Besides, you can still add all the Bootstrap plugins invididually as and when you require that functionality. <em>It's the best of both worlds.</em></p>
